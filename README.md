The FlowStacks Hello World Example for Learning How to Integrate your Applications or Systems with your own deployed REST API Services running on FlowStacks
------
Version:    2.0

Compatible: FlowStacks Beta Release


Repository Information
------
The FlowStacks Hello World Repository introduces new users to the FlowStacks platform for connecting your Applications and Systems to a REST API Service hosting your own Jobs (found in src). Using the FlowStacks REST API invokes your own Jobs to accomplish work on our platform for your applications or systems which could be as simple as creating, retrieving, updating, deleting databases records or advanced general purpose processing. This Repository will be maintained as a starting point for all new users to the FlowStacks platform to build derived value from creating Jobs that can be shared between GitHub users having similar use cases and needs. This includes building a shared database schema that is used by the Jobs as a data solution for these common, shared Jobs. Consider account management, many users need account management and building out these Jobs can be shared across markets, industries and users...as well as anything else that can be put into a Job like inventory, marketing, advertising, ecomm, subscription, and many more.


How to Use this Repository
------
To start developing Jobs just Fork this repo and deploy it with our Developer Dashboard: https://flowstacks.com/dashboard/


Additional Starting Information
------
1. Similar to most open source projects, getting changes into the master version for other users follows this general process: fork and clone the repo, put changes into a branch, and open a Pull Request once you are ready to get the commits into a review, which puts the commits on the direct path to get merged back into the master version.
2. More information can be found in our Beta documentation section here: https://flowstacks.com/documentation/
3. Feel free to close source the contents of this repository as you see fit, FlowStacks can deploy GitHub User Private Repositories too.
